# Chains & Networks

Chain and network information for use with hooks, connectors, and anywhere else you need in your app.

## chain

Object containing chains by name. Useful for creating lists of specific chains, like `defaultL2Chains`.

```ts
import { chain } from 'wagmi'

const defaultL2Chains = [chain.optimism, chain.arbitrumOne]
```

## Default Groups

wagmi has built-in chain groups for convenience:

```ts
import {
  allChains,
  defaultChains, // mainnet, rinkeby, etc.
  defaultL2Chains, // arbitrum, optimism
} from 'wagmi'
```
