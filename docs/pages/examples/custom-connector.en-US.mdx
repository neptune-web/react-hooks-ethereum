# Create Custom Connector

wagmi has a number of [built-in](/docs/connectors/injected) [Connectors](/docs/connectors/walletconnect) that cover support for tens of millions of wallets. If none of the built-in connectors work for your app, you can create a custom Connector. Creating a custom Connector is surpisingly easy to do.

## Prerequisite: Decide What Type of Connector to Create

You can ask yourself the following questions to decide what type of connector to create:

- **Do you want to create a connector for an [injected](/docs/connectors/injected) wallet (e.g. browser wallet or extension)?** You can likely extend the `InjectedConnector` class. The `MetaMaskConnector` is a good example of this (check out the [source code](https://github.com/tmm/wagmi/blob/main/packages/core/src/connectors/metaMask.ts) for more info).
- **Do you want to create a non-injected connector (e.g. wrap an existing SDK)?** Both `WalletConnectConnector` and `CoinbaseWalletConnector` wrap underlying SDKs and are good examples of this. Continue reading to learn more!

## Step 1: Extend Connector

Create a new class that extends `Connector` and implement required methods. `Connector` is exported by both `wagmi` and `@wagmi/core` packages.

```ts
import { Connector, Chain } from 'wagmi'
import { CoolWalletOptions, CoolWalletProvider } from 'cool-wallet-sdk'

export class CoolWalletConnector extends Connector<
  CoolWalletProvider,
  CoolWalletOptions
> {
  readonly id = 'coolWallet'
  readonly name = 'Cool Wallet'
  readonly ready = true

  #provider?: CoolWalletProvider

  constructor(config: { chains?: Chain[]; options: CoolWalletOptions }) {
    super(config)
  }

  async getProvider() {
    if (!this.#provider) {
      this.#provider = new CoolWalletProvider(this.options)
    }
    return this.#provider
  }

  // Implement other methods
  // connect, disconnect, getAccount, etc.
}
```

## Step 2: Use Connector

Once your custom Connector class is set up, you are ready to use it! You can plug it in anywhere built-in connectors work.

```ts
import { defaultChains, createClient } from 'wagmi'

import { CoolWalletConnector } from './CoolWalletConnector'

const connector = new CoolWalletConnector({
  chains: defaultChains,
  options: {
    // Custom connector options
  },
})

const client = createClient({
  connectors: [connector],
})
```

## Step 3: Share With Others

Congrats! You created a custom wagmi Connector! Others might benefit from this work and knowledge. You are welcome to publish your custom Connector as a standalone package or tell folks about it by [creating a new GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/tmm/wagmi/discussions/new?category=show-and-tell).

If the Connector covers a unique/useful use-case and enough folks are interested, it might make sense for your custom Connector to be built into wagmi. You can [start a new discussion](https://github.com/tmm/wagmi/discussions/new?category=ideas) to tell us more about the use-case, and why it should be included. It's not always possible to add new built-in connectors to wagmi as they increase the surface area for the core team, but it could make sense!
