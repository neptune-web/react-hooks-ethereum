# Getting Started

## Installation

Inside your React project directory, run the following:

```
yarn add wagmi ethers
```

Or with npm:

```
npm install wagmi ethers
```

## Quick Start

Wrap your app with the [**Provider**](/docs/provider) component:

```tsx
import { Provider } from 'wagmi'

const App = () => (
  <Provider>
    <YourRoutes />
  </Provider>
)
```

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  Provider has multiple configuration options: setting up available connectors
  (i.e. WalletConnect), auto connecting to wallets, etc. Check
  [here](/docs/provider#options) for more examples.
</Callout>

Now every component inside and under the **Provider** is set up to use hooks:

```tsx
import { useAccount, useConnect } from 'wagmi'

export const App = () => {
  const [{ data, error, loading }, disconnect] = useAccount({
    fetchBalance: true,
    fetchEns: true,
  })

  return ...
}
```
