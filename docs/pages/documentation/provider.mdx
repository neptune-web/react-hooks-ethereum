# Provider

In order to use a Supabase client, you need to provide it via the [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html). This may be done with the help of the Provider export.

```tsx
import { Provider } from 'wagmi'

const App = () => (
  <Provider>
    <YourRoutes />
  </Provider>
)
```

All examples and code snippets from now on assume that they are wrapped in a `Provider`.

## Parameters

- `autoConnect`: (_optional_) Enables reconnecting to last used connector on mount.
- `connectorStorageKey = 'wagmiWallet'`: (_optional_) Key for saving connector preference to browser
- `connectors = [new InjectedConnector()]`: (_optional_) Connectors used for linking accounts
- `provider = getDefaultProvider()`: (_optional_) Interface for connecting to network
- `webSocketProvider`: (_optional_) WebSocket interface for connecting to network
