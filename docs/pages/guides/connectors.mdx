# Connectors

Connectors allow users to securely connect their wallet to your app. When using wagmi, you configure whatever connectors you want to use and wagmi handles the rest!

## Built-in Connectors

wagmi has built-in wallet connectors for [Injected](/docs/connectors/injected) (i.e. MetaMask), [WalletConnect](/docs/connectors/walletConnect) (i.e. Rainbow), and [Coinbase Wallet](/docs/connectors/coinbaseWallet). Tens of millions of users are supported by these options and they are very fast to set up!

## Creating A Custom Connector

If none of the built-in connectors work for your app, you can create a custom connector by extending the `Connector` class:

```ts
import { Connector } from 'wagmi'

export class CoolL2CustomConnector extends Connector {
  name = 'My Cool Custom Connector for L2s'

  constructor(config) {
    super(config)
  }

  // Implement other methods
}
```

  If you create a custom connector, consider creating a [pull
  request](https://github.com/tmm/wagmi/pulls) to make it a built-in.
</Callout>

Then, use it just like any other connector:

```ts
import { defaultL2Chains } from 'wagmi'

import { CoolL2CustomConnector } from './CoolL2CustomConnector'

const connector = new CoolL2CustomConnector({
  chains: defaultL2Chains,
  options: {
    // Custom connector options
  },
})
```
