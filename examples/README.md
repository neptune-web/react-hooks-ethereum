What makes a good example is focus. There's certainly room for examples that show off a whole app experience, but the vast majority of useful examples are focused on a specific use-case. Otherwise, it's hard for people to know what to look for in the code.

This means you should avoid adding stuff that isn't absolutely necessary for the example. Start with bare bones and add only what you need.

Most examples should:

- Support commonly-used, Ethereum-related networks (Mainnet, Optimism, Polygon, etc.)
- Have only necessary dependencies
- Use TypeScript
- Be as practical as reasonable (balanced with the focus)

The example name should be clear and consice, focusing on the use-case or main technology being demonstrated.

Once you are ready, open up a pull request with the example.
